# Colour

> Not a man breathed for several seconds. Then a cloud of darker depth
passed over the moon, and the silhouette of clutching branches faded
out momentarily. At this there was a general cry; muffled with awe,
but husky and almost identical from every throat. For the terror had
not faded with the silhouette, and in a fearsome instant of deeper
darkness the watchers saw wriggling at that tree top height a thousand
tiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance, tipping each bough like
the fire of St. Elmo or the flames that come down on the apostles'
heads at Pentecost. It was a monstrous constellation of unnatural
light, like a glutted swarm of corpse-fed fireflies dancing hellish
sarabands over an accursed marsh, and its colour was that same
nameless intrusion which Ammi had come to recognize and dread. All the
while the shaft of phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter
and brighter, bringing to the minds of the huddled men, a sense of
doom and abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious
minds could form. It was no longer shining out; it was pouring out;
and as the shapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it
seemed to flow directly into the sky.

â€” H. P. Lovecraft, *The Colour Out of Space*
